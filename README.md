# Housing prices in Dublin

Finding a place to live has become one of the major problems in Ireland, especially in Dublin. Each year the prices dramatically increase and there are less apartments available for renting. The main reasons for that are a lot of people moving to Dublin and many Ukranian refugees coming to Ireland as well. In addition to that, Ireland is the only English speaking country in EU, so it makes it easier for people moving into the country to live there. As it is an English speaking country, many people come here to study, because it is relatively cheap to study in English in Ireland compared to other countries, like the UK or the US.

I was interested what prices are for this year for renting an apartment, and I wanted to visualize them. So I wrote a simple python script that scrapes some data of available apartments from one of the most popular website in Ireland for finding a place to live, daft.ie, and I have got over 260 results.

As we can see on the image, the average price really depends on a Dublin area. Nevertheless, like in most cities, the highest prices are focused in the city center. Dublin 4 is the heart of the city, one of the most expensive places to live in Dublin, and the avarage price to rent an apartment is nearly 7000 euros per month!

I used to believe that the south part of Dublin is much more expensive than the north part, but if we look at the map, this is not really the case, there is a price different, but not as much as I thought there would be.
